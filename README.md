# GameplayEssentials for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3

A babric mod for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 that fixes gameplay bugs and adds a few gameplay features.
* Mod works on Multiplayer with [GlassConfigAPI](https://modrinth.com/mod/glass-config-api) version 3.0+ used to sync configs!
* [StationAPI](https://modrinth.com/mod/stationapi) is optional and used for recipe configs

## Gameplay Bugfixes

* Fix bucket being consumed when lava bucket is used in furnace
* Fix slimes not dropping slimeballs when an attack brings them below zero health
* Fix minecarts stopping on items/arrows
* Fix mobs jittering in multiplayer
* Fix fish flying above player head (default: false)
    * Default false because during multiplayer testing it was found that vanilla behavior is more correct

## Gameplay Features

* Change bed behavior: vanilla, disable nightmares, set spawn-point only, or disable entirely
* Allow disabling block interactions with a keybind (thereby allowing things like placing torches on crafting tables)
* Allow disabling eating when at max health (default: false)
* Allow pressure plates to be placed on fences
* Allow sugar cane to be placed on sand
* Allow trapdoors to be placed without support
* Change jack-o'-lantern recipe to be shapeless
